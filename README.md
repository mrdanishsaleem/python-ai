## Chatbot ü§ñ

### Features

- In this activity, we will be using a Python library, chatterbot, to implement a chatbot.
- This library generates automated responses to the user input. The responses are based on machine learning algorithms implemented in the library.
- Our goal is to make sure that the chatbot is trained in multiple languages in order to cater to different communities.
- The ML algorithms make it easier for the chatbot to improve and evolve its responses over time as it collects user responses.

### ‚öôÔ∏é Steps to run ai-calculator.py file

- Download the chatbot folder and open it in your Python IDE.
- Run `main.py` file and have fun with your AI-based bot.
